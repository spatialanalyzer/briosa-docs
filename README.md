# Briosa documentation

This repository contains the public documentation site for
[Briosa](https://github.com/spatialanalyzer/briosa), an open-source gRPC bridge
around the Hexagon SpatialAnalyzer SDK.

The site is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and published to
[spatialanalyzer.github.io/briosa-docs](https://spatialanalyzer.github.io/briosa-docs/).

## Local development

Use Node.js 24:

```powershell
npm ci
npm start
```

Build the same static output used by GitHub Pages:

```powershell
npm run check
```

## Documentation boundary

The [Briosa server repository](https://github.com/spatialanalyzer/briosa) is the
source of truth for protobuf contracts, supported operations, runtime behavior,
and exact SpatialAnalyzer target compatibility. This repository explains that
surface; it must not define or broaden it.

SpatialAnalyzer and the SA SDK are Hexagon products. Briosa is an independent
open-source project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by
Hexagon. A separately installed and licensed SpatialAnalyzer environment is
required for useful MP execution.
